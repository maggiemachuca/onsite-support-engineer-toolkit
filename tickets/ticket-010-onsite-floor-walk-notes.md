## 🆔 **Ticket Summary**

## 🧭 **Objective of Floor Walk**

- Provide friendly, face-to-face support

## 🧍 **Onsite User Interactions (Rapport-Building)**

### **1. Reception Desk — Quick Wins**
Spoke with reception staff and asked:

> “Good morning! While I’m onsite, is there anything acting unusual with your computer or phone system?”

This approach is:
- Friendly  
- Low-pressure  
- Creates immediate trust  

**Findings:**  
- One user had difficulty locating shared folders (simple navigation issue).  
- Resolved on the spot and gave a brief walkthrough.  

**Impact:**  
User said:  
> “Thank you, I didn’t want to bother anyone with a small question.”  

*This is exactly why floor walks matter.*

---

### **2. Customer Service — Minor Headset Issue**
Checked in with Customer Service workstations.

One user mentioned:

> “Teams keeps switching my audio device.”

Diagnosed:
- Headset listed twice (Bluetooth + USB)
- Bluetooth profile intermittently taking priority

Fix:
- Disabled Bluetooth audio profile  
- Set USB headset as default communication device  

User reaction:
> “You’re a lifesaver — thanks for stopping by!”

---

### **3. Sales Department — Teams Login Error**
User reported intermittent sign-in issues.

Steps:
- Cleared Teams cache  
  ```
  %appdata%\Microsoft\Teams
  ```
- Reopened Teams → Login succeeded  

Explained root cause in simple, user-friendly language:
> “Teams saves old cache files that sometimes confuse the login. Clearing them forces a fresh sign-in.”

User appreciated the explanation:
> “That makes sense now! Thanks for explaining it.”

---

### **4. Department Manager Conversation — Building Trust**

Had a quick check-in with Sales Manager:

> “While I’m onsite, is there anything your team has been running into lately that we might not know about?”

Manager mentioned:
- Occasional delays with network printer  
- Two new hires arriving next week  
- Interest in knowing how to submit tickets more efficiently  

Actions:
- Wrote down specific details for follow-up  
- Offered to create an updated “How to Submit Tickets” guide  
- Scheduled time to look into printer delays  

Manager response:
> “I really appreciate that. You’re always helpful when you’re onsite.”

This is the rapport MSPs want you to build.

## 🧪 **Proactive Technical Checks**

During the walk, performed quick workstation health checks:

- Verified Windows Updates installed  
- Checked free disk space  
- Verified network connectivity (ping test)  
- Ensured antivirus status was green  
- Confirmed printers were available in user profiles  
- Restarted systems with uptime > 14 days  
- Noted workstations needing patching  

---

## 📝 **Issues Resolved Onsite (No Ticket Needed)**

✔ Teams cache cleared for login issue  
✔ Headset priority fixed  
✔ Printer queue cleared for one user  
✔ Quick tutorial for navigating shared folders  
✔ Startup application configuration optimized for two users  

These “quick wins” prevent future tickets — a huge value add.

## 🤝 **Client Rapport Demonstrated**

Throughout the walk:

- Used user-first language  
- Asked open-ended, non-intimidating questions  
- Explained issues in simple terms  
- Positioned myself as approachable, not “IT policing”  
- Ensured every interaction ended with:
