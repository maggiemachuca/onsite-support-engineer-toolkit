# 🧰 Onsite Support Engineer Toolkit  
*A practical, real-world collection of troubleshooting workflows, ticket documentation, and support processes based on my hands-on experience working in a managed support environment.*

---

## 📌 Overview
This repository showcases how I approach **real-world IT support tasks, documentation, ticketing workflows, and onsite client interactions**.  
It is based on the types of issues, processes, and responsibilities I handled during my internship in a technical support environment.

All examples are **anonymized recreations**, reflecting the same style of documentation, troubleshooting logic, and communication standards required in MSP and onsite support roles.

This project demonstrates:

- ✔ My troubleshooting methodology  
- ✔ My ability to follow MSP workflows  
- ✔ My ticket documentation discipline

## 🤝 Connection to My Experience
During my internship, I supported users in an environment where:

- Tickets had to be thoroughly documented  
- AD, Windows, and networking issues were routine  
- Escalations followed strict SOPs  
- Communication with users was essential  
- Procedures needed updates as new issues appeared  

Because I cannot share real client data, this repository contains **anonymized recreations** that mirror the workflows and standards I followed.

---

## 🚀 Future Updates
I will continue expanding this project with:

- Additional ticket examples  
- More troubleshooting case studies  
- New PowerShell scripts  
- Updated procedures and SOPs  
- Additional runbooks and guides  

As I grow in my IT career, **this project will grow with me.**
