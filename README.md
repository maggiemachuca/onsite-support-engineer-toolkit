# 🧰 Onsite Support Engineer Toolkit

A practical, real-world collection of troubleshooting workflows, ticket documentation, and support processes based on my hands-on experience working in a managed support environment.

📌 Overview

This repository showcases how I approach real-world IT support tasks, documentation, ticketing workflows, and onsite client interactions.
It is based on the actual types of issues, processes, and responsibilities I handled during my internship in a technical support environment. All examples are anonymized recreations, reflecting the same style of documentation, troubleshooting logic, and communication standards required in MSP and onsite support roles.

This project is designed to demonstrate:

- My troubleshooting methodology

- My ability to follow MSP workflows

- My ticket documentation discipline

- How I handle Active Directory, Windows, networking, and user support tasks

- My written communication style

- My readiness for an Onsite Support Engineer I position

This repo is not meant to be “busy work.”
It is meant to show how I think, how I document, and how I support users.

🎯 Purpose of This Project

Onsite Support Engineers must be able to:

- Triage and resolve user issues efficiently

- Communicate clearly with clients, vendors, and teams

- Follow SLAs and update tickets properly

- Document new findings (e.g., in IT Glue)

- Troubleshoot Windows, Active Directory, and networking issues

- Work independently while onsite

- Provide clean handoffs and accurate notes

This repository demonstrates how I practice all of the above.

🤝 Connection to My Experience

During my internship, I supported users in an environment where:

- Tickets had to be documented thoroughly

- AD, Windows, and networking issues were routine

- Escalations followed strict SOPs

- Communication was essential

- Procedures required updates as new issues were discovered

Because I cannot share real client data, this repository contains anonymized recreations that reflect the same workflows, troubleshooting logic, and documentation standards I used in my role.


---

🚀 Future Updates

I will continue expanding this project with:

- Additional ticket examples

- More troubleshooting case studies

- New PowerShell scripts

- Improved documentation

- Additional runbooks

As I grow in my IT career, this project will grow with me.
